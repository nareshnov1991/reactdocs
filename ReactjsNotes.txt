How do you use store in react?
It's simple to get access to the store inside a React component – no need to pass the store as a prop or import it, just use the connect function from React Redux, and supply a mapStateToProps function that pulls out the data you need. Then, inside the component, you can pass that data to a function that needs it


What is store in react Redux?
A store is an immutable object tree in Redux. A store is a state container which holds the application's state. Redux can have only a single store in your application. Whenever a store is created in Redux, you need to specify the reducer. Let us see how we can create a store using the createStore method from Redux.

connect()
https://react-redux.js.org/api/connect
The connect() function connects a React component to a Redux store.
It provides its connected component with the pieces of the data it needs from the store, and the functions it can use to dispatch actions to the store.
